- Be as polymorphic as possible

Initialise a language : randomly from rules, or from a file


we need to have two object hierarchies interacting : 
	⋅ the change hierarchies (phonetic, syntactic and semantic)
	⋅ the structure hierarchy (tree, relaxed tree, waves...)

- Tree model:
	generate a tree
	fill a tree with changes types


- generate changes
- when does a phonetic change becomes phonemic ?
- morphology
- analogy

- a proper way to write and read changes in a human readable way (more or less)

- semantic shifts

- Relaxed Tree :
	borrowings : 
	--	when is a borrowing mapped onto its new host's phonology ?
	--	When does new sound get borrowed along the way ?

- Wave model 

- Maps
